Version Adjustment (2022.02.05) :



1. Changed weapon dark lance damage, added bone claw to damage shadow creature mechanism;

2. Change the drop rate and damage of guns and bullets, and the composition of bullets, etc. As for the small problem of gun use, it is suggested to use the gun after using the musket once, (the musket is dropped by the Goblin probability) then the rate of fire will become normal, I did not find the specific BUG;

3. Changed the damage of Bone Bow, bone Dagger, bone sword, bone axe, etc., adjusted the armor of bone bow, bone helmet, ghost armor, etc., added the attack of SAN regeneration, ghost armor and Green Dragon Crescent Blade can be combined.

4. Change the equipment held by the invading monster, and the drop rate and attribute of the corresponding equipment;

5. Slightly reduce the frequency of invasions and increase the number of invasions (there are few invasions in the early stage, and gradually increase in the later stage, and the health will also increase with time, giving most players time to build their homes in the early stage);

6. The rogue value of kill creatures has been slightly reduced (the intelligent hostile Campus is very unfriendly to freshmen, reducing the chance to summon campus in favor of ordinary players);

7. There is no humanoid weapon invasion in war difficulty, but there is a very low chance of summoning the original humanoid weapon such as Fire Woman, Grandma, and skeleton elite team when building and eating. Humanoid weapons will be introduced in Hell mode (peace mode has no invasion, practice mode has Axe Gang, Goblins and Wolves, War mode adds Skeleton Corps and Boy Scouts, Hell mode adds humanoid weapons);

8. Slightly reduces the base health of humanoid weapons, increasing their health as they live;

Some of the gameplay and difficulty has been modified and adjusted, hoping that more players can start playing; There are some small bugs, but they do not affect the overall operation. I have no time to find the code. First, I am not a computer related major, so the speed is slow and the time is short. Second, this mod is not created by myself, and there are many files, it does take longer to find files and codes, and then have a closer look when you are free, hope to understand.

Compatibility issues with other larger mods are common and often not just a matter of which side changes the code. Finally, I wish you have fun!
